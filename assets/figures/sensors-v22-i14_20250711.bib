ABSTRACT = {A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a typical acoustic transducer that undergoes a frequency shift due to changes in the mass of its surface. Its high sensitivity, robustness, small size design, and digital output have led to its widespread development for application in the fields of chemistry, physics, biology, medicine, and surface science. Mass sensitivity is one of the vital parameters and forms the basis for quantitative analysis using QCMs. This review firstly introduces the importance, definition, calculation, and measuring method of the mass sensitivity and then focuses on reviewing the influence of electrode parameters (including electrode shape, electrode diameter, electrode thickness, electrode material, etc.) on the mass sensitivity distribution of QCMs. Finally, the effect of the operating frequency on the mass sensitivity of QCMs is also analyzed.},
