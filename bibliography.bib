abstract = {Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), being a mass-sensitive sensor, has the benefit of achieving high accuracy (up to nanogram level), providing real-time digital frequency output, and being easy to operate. QCM has been extensively studied in the areas of chemistry, physics, and biology due to its ability to provide real-time monitoring, characterize (biological) membrane deposition, detect specific antigens, and investigate cell adhesion. This review seeks to explore the potential of QCM in the future by providing an overview of its technical principles, applications in environmental monitoring, cells, enzymatic hydrolysis, and other fields in recent years.}

abstract = {High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and linear-ion trap (LTQ)/Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry were used to identify porcine gelatins extracted at different temperatures. Moreover, shear stress rheological detection techniques and a texture analyzer were applied to evaluate the gelling properties of various porcine gelatins. The results showed that, with an increased in the extraction temperature, the gel strength, gelation point and melting point of the porcine gelatin gradually decreased, indicating that the temperature significantly affected the gelling properties of gelatin. HPLC- LTQ/Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry indicated that porcine gelatins prepared at different extraction temperatures also showed internal uniqueness, namely, diverse marker peptides for gelatin identification. Compared with the established theoretical sequence fragment database of porcine gelatin and bovine gelatin, 64, 74 and 71 tryptic porcine peptides in gelatins were extracted at 55 °C, 65 °C and 75 °C, respectively. Notably, regardless of the extraction temperature, 47 common peptides were detected in the tryptic hydrolysates of porcine gelatins. Using these common tryptic peptides can effectively improve the accuracy of the porcine gelatin identification.}

ABSTRACT = {A quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is a typical acoustic transducer that undergoes a frequency shift due to changes in the mass of its surface. Its high sensitivity, robustness, small size design, and digital output have led to its widespread development for application in the fields of chemistry, physics, biology, medicine, and surface science. Mass sensitivity is one of the vital parameters and forms the basis for quantitative analysis using QCMs. This review firstly introduces the importance, definition, calculation, and measuring method of the mass sensitivity and then focuses on reviewing the influence of electrode parameters (including electrode shape, electrode diameter, electrode thickness, electrode material, etc.) on the mass sensitivity distribution of QCMs. Finally, the effect of the operating frequency on the mass sensitivity of QCMs is also analyzed.},

journal = {Physica Scripta},
abstract = {We have derived the general solution of a wave equation describing the dynamics of two-layer viscoelastic polymer materials of arbitrary thickness deposited on solid (quartz) surfaces in a fluid environment. Within the Voight model of viscoelastic element, we calculate the acoustic response of the system to an applied shear stress, i.e. we find the shift of the quartz generator resonance frequency and of the dissipation factor, and show that it strongly depends on the viscous loading of the adsorbed layers and on the shear storage and loss moduli of the overlayers. These results can readily be applied to quartz crystal acoustical measurements of the viscoelasticity of polymers which conserve their shape under the shear deformations and do not flow, and layered structures such as protein films adsorbed from solution onto the surface of self-assembled monolayers.}
