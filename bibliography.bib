abstract = {Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), being a mass-sensitive sensor, has the benefit of achieving high accuracy (up to nanogram level), providing real-time digital frequency output, and being easy to operate. QCM has been extensively studied in the areas of chemistry, physics, and biology due to its ability to provide real-time monitoring, characterize (biological) membrane deposition, detect specific antigens, and investigate cell adhesion. This review seeks to explore the potential of QCM in the future by providing an overview of its technical principles, applications in environmental monitoring, cells, enzymatic hydrolysis, and other fields in recent years.}
